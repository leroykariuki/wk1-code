# Coding Challenges Solutions

This repository contains solutions to three coding challenges in Python.

## Challenge 1: Converting 12-hour Time to 24-hour Time

This code snippet converts a 12-hour time to 24-hour time format. It defines a function that takes an hour (1 to 12), minute (0 to 59), and period ("am" or "pm") as input. The function returns a four-digit string representing the time in 24-hour format.

To run the code, simply execute the provided Python script. The program will prompt you to input the hour, minute, and period, and it will display the converted 24-hour time.

## Challenge 2: Exactly Two Positive Numbers

This code snippet defines a function that checks if exactly two out of three given integers are positive. It takes three integers as input and returns `True` if the condition is met, and `False` otherwise.

To run the code, execute the provided Python script. You will be asked to input the three integers, and the program will display whether the condition is satisfied.

## Challenge 3: Highest Value of Consonant Substrings

This code snippet calculates the highest value of consonant substrings in a given lowercase string. It assigns values to consonant letters and finds the highest value of substrings formed by consecutive consonants.

To run the code, execute the provided Python script. You will be prompted to input a lowercase alphabetic string. The program will calculate and display the highest value of consonant substrings.

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the desired code snippet.
4. Run the Python script using the `python` command (e.g., `python3 code_1.py`).
5. Follow the prompts and input required data.
6. View the output displayed in the terminal.
